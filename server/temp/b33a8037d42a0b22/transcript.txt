 Seven foot five, he's gonna shoot over. Not many guys can really defend him. And the ball handling is what makes him special to me. It's not anything else, but it's a ability to handle the basketball. And I don't agree with all that. I think it's gonna be a huge adjustment. The physicality. You think the NBA physical now? I think it's gonna be more physical. He plan against the Czech Republic. I mean, he gonna be playing against grown men. And he gonna have to guard those guys on the other end also, which gonna bring him into foul trouble. It's not gonna be. Listen, I've been in the NBA for 40 years. I ain't seen, but one guy, one guy who didn't go to college, who came in who was ready. And that's LeBron. Kobe was great. He struggled early. Kavga Gardette was great. He struggled early. The White Howard, feel struggling in Taiwan. Just joking, De White. I'm not mad. I don't even keep up with that. I don't even know. I'm not a crazy like Jack. What will Victor be great at some point? I don't know the answers to that. I can't see you since struggling great.
