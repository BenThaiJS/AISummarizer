 Let's go. Let's go. Oh, my God. Look, if you look at it, it goes, but I just let it grow up. I watched the show tonight. I just want to say you look like a damn idiot. There it was the other night. It doesn't look like hair to me, shak. That looks like Ernie's hair. You had a black Ernie just? Like you went to... Like you went to... Oh, okay. You're not exact with skinny. I'm skinny with you. You never heard those words, man. Shak, you look like you lose weight. The words I've never heard before. I just want you to think about that question, can you? I'm gonna think about it. No, it's a little... Really great. Just a little brain teaser before we go to do. Don't you have to have a brain to tease some people? We will take a short break. And the clippers... Oh, we're back! Clippers and liners. I'm just saying. All you got to do is win a dunk contest to be called Superman. Don't call me that no more. That's all I'm saying. Oh, no. Hey, we don't call you Superman anymore. I'm just saying. We don't call you Superman anymore. We don't call you Superman anymore. Hey, just a case who is wondering what that is. How does that... No, no, listen. Well, what's one that's Rudy? I'd say Rudy's the guy... The bear. Yeah, I do. Yeah. You're thinking Rudy's the good bear. I'd say Rudy's the bear. I would... Shak, what do you... You're the doctor. Okay, I'm not a doctor. Not a good one. Better than you, bitch. So Steph Curry sprains the mediocre lateral ligament. Still no demonstrated a cat scan and cat food. No, man. I'm not a scub over that. I thought I was always talking about food. Okay, over that. All right, I'm talking about food. He's like, he's like, he's like, he's like... No, we'll hear his post-game thoughts on... You know what? That last year in Boston, he played like a slug. You were barely making it up and down, McCourt. Yeah, but when I got home, I looked at my cat, and I saw four things that you would never see. What's that? All right, and don't ask. All right, and you, yes. You said, all right. He got it. I was like, I'm a little bit against it. I wonder if everybody remembers the numbers they've always worn. So a quick quiz here for Shaquille O'Neal, like the Celtics. 36. 36? Why 36? That's how many points you had in like, in a month. No, I think... I think... Cavaliers? 33. Why 33? That's how many points you had in two months. That's how many points you had in two months. Four things that you got in the back. Oh, man. Oh, man. No problem. Okay. There's a difference between criticism and personal. I guarantee you, LeBron wasn't mad at the wine-eal, the inappropriate. When you said that man doesn't want to compete, that's what ticked him up. And I would have did the same thing. I would have came right back at your wreck. I would have came up here and punched you in your face. That's what I would have did. Well, first of all, you're not a good fighter. Listen. All right, first of all, lower your tone when you talk about me. You're talking about as you want to. Stop it with all of you. No, you're talking about as you want to. Stop it with all of you. No, you're talking about as you want to. And just for the record, you couldn't play in the day's game because you had... They shoot three. You wouldn't even get in the game today. First of all, I only talk to champions. Anywhere, kiddie. Anywhere, kiddie. I'm sorry. You can't shoot three. I'm sorry. You want a good shot by my... You want a good shot by my... You want a good shot by my... No, he's not a bad guy. I'm sorry. I played with John. But, you know, when Michael Jordan told me that quote, you were the first one to be successful. You succeed, you must first know. He didn't tell you what the big thing I'm doing. I'm too... Yeah, he... I did. I like it. Next time I do it. You like him, tell him what? He's gonna go after you and I'm gonna fall over the edge here. That's all I give you. That's all I give you. You got that water. You got that water. You'll see it. You got that water. You'll see it. You'll see it. God's light. Overrated it. Tell him why you mad, bro. That's a big, big, big, big, big. If it weren't for the Wayne Wade and Colvin Bryant, you'd never even heard of you. Because you've only been to the final once. I didn't know that. You don't know the way in ways and Colvin's Colt tails. It doesn't matter, Chuck, I got the same thing you got and I pass you up to him. Just letting you know. Anyway. And I would've been riding on Colvin's Colt tails anyway. Anyway. And a lot of more in those guys. I forgot about that. And a lot of more in those guys. And a big box. Rick Fox. People question why you had all this fun anywhere. I had... I would say this... What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing, Striek and in the middle of a street? You going across the street and you're underwear? You see who went... No, I was swimming. Swimming where? It's a pool in my office, fool. I was somebody hit your ass. Me too. He's somebody run over. I can't go. I can't do it. I can't do it. Come on. I can't hold. I can't hold. I can't hold. Come on. It's not going to happen. I was going to be one of us that game. Ernie, I want Kenny to tell you a story how I kidnapped Ken J. How long ago was this? He went in kindergarten. He was in kindergarten and his daughter. My daughter. I mean, my NKJ went to the same school. And I came to the school and picked him up and he was like, oh, he's gone with Shack. He was like, what do you mean he's gone with Shack? I said, I don't even know on this phone number. I didn't call him. I think it's you knew him. But in Pharaoh... Inning. He might have got a confusion on his seventh. That was wrong. That was wrong. That was wrong, Chuck. No, you know. Cross a line, Chuck. You insulted him a little bit. Yeah. It's my youngest son's birthday today. Shakir, big dude. Happy birthday. Love you, brother. You know what's going to happen. I was joking. I was joking. I was joking. I was joking. I was joking. I was joking. That's a wrap for Inside the NBA. Tomorrow another kid of Shakir LaNille will be announcing, too. It's presented by Kia. For Charles and Kenny and for Shack and Sharif. Ernie Johnson. Porine, call me.
