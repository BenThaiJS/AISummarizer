Let's go. Let's go. Oh, my God. Look, if you look at it, it goes, but I just let it grow up. I watched the show tonight. I just want to say you look like a damn idiot. There it was the other night. It doesn't look like hair to me, shak. That looks like Ernie's hair. You had a black Ernie just? Like you went to... Like you went to... Oh, okay. You're not exact with skinny. I'm skinny with you. You never heard those words, man. Shak, you look like you lose weight. The words I've never heard before. I just want you to think about that question, can you? I'm gonna think about it. No, it's a little... Really great. Just a little brain teaser before we go to do. Don't you have to have a brain to tease some people? We will take a short break. And the clippers... Oh, we're back! Clippers and liners. I'm just saying. All you got to do is win a dunk contest to be called Superman. Don't call me that no more. That's all I'm saying. Oh, no. Hey, we don't call you Superman anymore. I'm just saying. We don't call you Superman anymore. We don't call you Superman anymore. Hey, just a case who is wondering what that is. How does that... No, no, listen. Well, what's one that's Rudy? I'd say Rudy's the guy... The bear. Yeah, I do. Yeah. You're thinking Rudy's the good bear. I'd say Rudy's the bear. I would... Shak, what do you... You're the doctor. Okay, I'm not a doctor. Not a good one. Better than you, bitch. So Steph Curry sprains the mediocre lateral ligament. Still no demonstrated a cat scan and cat food. No, man. I'm not a scub over that. I thought I was always talking about food. Okay, over that. All right, I'm talking about food. He's like, he's like, he's like, he's like... No, we'll hear his post-game thoughts on... You know what? That last year in Boston, he played like a slug. You were barely making it up and down, McCourt. Yeah, but when I got home, I looked at my cat, and I saw four things that you would never see. What's that? All right, and don't ask. All right, and you, yes. You said, all right. He got it. You did something else against it, I wonder if everybody remembers the numbers they've always worn. So, a quick quiz here for Shaqille O'Neil, right? The, uh, Celtics. Thirty-six. Thirty-six. Why, thirty-six? That's how many points you had like in a month. No, I'm not sure. Three. All right, Cavaliers. Thirty-three. Why, thirty-three. That's how many points you had in two months. If I had four wins, you'd have one. Oh, man. Oh, man. No, I'm not doing this to say that. There's a difference between criticism and personal. I guarantee you, LaBron wasn't mad at the wine-eal, the inappropriate. When you said that man doesn't want to compete, that's what ticked him up. And I would have did the same thing. I would have came right back at your wreck. I would have came up here and punched you in your face. That's what I would have did. Well, first of all, you're not a good fighter. Listen. All right, first of all, lower your tone when you talk about me. Go better. Kid, you talk as loud as you want to. Stop it with all of you. No, you talk as loud as you want to, Kid. Stop it with all of you. And just for the record, you couldn't plan the day's game because you had, they shoot three. They wouldn't even, you wouldn't even get in the game today. First of all, I only talk to champions. Anywhere, Kid. Anywhere, Kid. I'm sorry. You can't shoot three. I'm sorry. You want a good shot by my side? You want him got in the league today? No, he's not got record. I play with John. But when Michael Jordan told me that quote, before you succeed, you must first know him. He didn't tell you what the big thing I'm doing. Yeah, see? I did. I like it. Next time I go, you like him, then what? He's going to go after you and I'm going to fall over the edge here. That's it. You got that water. You got that water. You'll see it. You got it. Guys, lie down. Overrated. Tell them why you mad, bro. Hey, you were very far up. If it weren't for the Wayne Wade and Kobe Bryant, you've never even heard of you. Because you've only been to the final once. I didn't know that. I didn't know that. The Wayne Wade and Kobe's co-tails. It doesn't matter. I got the same thing you got. And I passed you up, genius. Just letting you know. I've had it. Anyway, his co-tails. Anyway. And a lot of those guys. I forgot about that. That's one for those guys. And a big box. Rick Fox. People question why you have all this. I said, anyway, bum. I would say this. What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? Stinking in the middle of a street. You going across the street and you're underwear? Yeah. To see who we're. No, I was swimming. Swimming where? It's a pool in my office, fool. Okay. I was somebody hit your ass. Me too. He's somebody run over. I'm gonna hit him. I'm gonna hit him. I'm gonna hit him. I'm gonna hit him. I'm gonna hit him. I'm gonna hit him. Come on. It's not gonna happen. He's gonna be going to watch that game. Ernie, I want Kenny to tell you a story how I kidnap KJ. How long ago was this? He was in kindergarten. He was in kindergarten and his daughter and my daughter. I mean, my and KJ went to the same school. And I came to the school, pick him up and he was like, oh, he's going with Shaq. And I was like, what do you mean he's going with Shaq? I said, I don't even know on this phone number. I had a call number. I think it's you knew it. But in Pharaoh, Ernie, he might have got a confusion when his seventh son... That was wrong. That was wrong, Shaq. Shaq, you know, cross the line, Shaq. You insulted him a little bit. Yeah. My youngest son's birthday today. She's cute, big dude, happy birthday. Love you, brother. You know what? It's all a happy birthday. I was joking. Hey, I wish you all your kids happy birthday. This only happened to our show. That's a wrap for inside the NBA. Tomorrow another kid of Shaqila Neal will be announcing, too. It's presented by IKEA for Charles and Kenny and for Shaq and Sharif. Ernie Johnson, see you tomorrow. All right, call me. Ha! No, no, no, no.
