Clippers and liners. I'm just saying. All you got to do is win a dunk contest to be called Superman. Don't call me that no more. That's all I'm saying. Oh, no. Hey, we don't call you Superman anymore. I'm just saying. We don't call you Superman anymore. We don't call you Superman anymore. Hey, just a case who is wondering what that is. How does that...

No, we'll hear his post-game thoughts on... You know what? That last year in Boston, he played like a slug. You were barely making it up and down, McCourt. Yeah, but when I got home, I looked at my cat, and I saw four things that you would never see. What's that? All right, and don't ask. All right, and you, yes. You said, all right. He got it. That's a big difference against him. And I wonder if everybody remembers the numbers they've always worn. So a quick quiz here for Shaquille O'Neal, or the Celtics. 36. 36. Why 36? That's how many points you had, like, in a month? No, I have to go ahead. I think... Okay, cavaliers. 33. Why 33? That's how many points you had in two months.

You want a good shot by my side? You want him got it illegal? No, he's not. I'm sorry. I play with John. But, you know, when Michael Jordan told me that quote, before you succeed, you must first know him. He didn't tell you what the big thing I'm doing. Yeah, see? I did. I like it. Next time I get one. You like him, then what? He's going to go after you and I'm going to fall over the edge here. That's it. You got that water. You got that water. Thank you for that. You'll see it. Guys, lie down.

Ernie, I want Kenny to tell you a story how I kidnap KJ. How long ago was this? He went kindergarten. He was in kindergarten and hit his daughter and my daughter. I mean, my NKJ went to the same school. And I came to the school pick him up. And they were like, oh, he's gone with shack. And I was like, what do you mean he's gone with shack?
