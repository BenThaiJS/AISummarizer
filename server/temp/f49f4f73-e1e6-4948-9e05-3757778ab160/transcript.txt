 Let's go. Let's go. Oh, my God. Look, if you look at it, it goes, but I just let it grow up. I watched the show tonight. I just want to say you look like a damn idiot. There it was the other night. It doesn't look like hair to me, shak. That looks like Ernie's hair. You had a black Ernie just? Like you went to... Like you went to... Oh, okay. You're not exact with skinny. I'm skinny with you. You never heard those words, man. Shak, you look like you lose weight. The words I've never heard before. I just want you to think about that question, can you? I'm gonna think about it. No, it's a little... Really great. Just a little brain teaser before we go to do. Don't you have to have a brain to tease some people? We will take a short break. And the clippers... Oh, we're back! Clippers and liners. I'm just saying. All you got to do is win a dunk contest to be called Superman. Don't call me that no more. That's all I'm saying. Oh, no. Hey, we don't call you Superman anymore. I'm just saying. We don't call you Superman anymore. We don't call you Superman anymore. Hey, just a case who is wondering what that is. How does that... No, no, listen. Well, what's one that's Rudy? I'd say Rudy's the guy... The bear. Yeah, I do. Yeah. You're thinking Rudy's the good bear. I'd say Rudy's the bear. I would... Shak, what do you... You're the doctor. Okay, I'm not a doctor. Not a good one. Better than you, bitch. So Steph Curry sprains the mediocre lateral ligament. Still no demonstrated a cat scan and cat food. No, man. I'm not a scub over that. I thought I was always talking about food. Okay, over that. All right, I'm talking about food. He's like, he's like, he's like, he's like... No, we'll hear his post-game thoughts on... You know what? That last year in Boston, he played like a slug. You were barely making it up and down, McCourt. Yeah, but when I got home, I looked at my cat, and I saw four things that you would never see. What's that? All right, and don't ask. All right, and you, yes. You said, all right. He got it. I was, I was against it, and I wonder if everybody remembers the numbers they've always worn. So a quick quiz here for Shaquille O'Neal, like the Celtics. 36. 36. Why 36? That's how many points you had in a month. No, I think. I think so. All right, Cavaliers. 33. Why 33? That's how many points you had in two months. That's how four things that you got in the back. Oh, man. Oh, man. Bro, this is the second. That's the second. There's a difference between criticism and personal. I guarantee you, LeBron wasn't mad at the wine eels, the inappropriate. When you said that man doesn't want to compete, that's what ticked him up. And I would have did the same thing. I would have came right back at your wreck. I would have came up here and punched you in your face. That's what I would have did. Well, first of all, you're not a good fighter. Listen. All right, first of all, lower your tone when you talk about me. You talk about me. Kid, you talk as loud as you want to. Stop it with all of you. No, you talk as loud as you want to. Kid, stop it with all of you. And just for the record, you couldn't plan the day's game because you had, they shoot three. They wouldn't even, you wouldn't even get in the game today. First of all, I only talk to champions. Anywhere, Kid. Anywhere, Kid. I'm sorry. You can't shoot three. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You want a good shot? You want to get in the league today? No, he's not. I'm sorry. I played with John. But, you know, when Michael Jordan told me that quote, before you succeed, you must first know. He didn't tell you what the big thing I'm doing. Yeah, see. I did. I like it. Next time I go, you like a title? Yeah. You know what? He's going to go after you and I'm going to fall over the edge here. That's what I'm giving you. That's what I'm giving you. You got that water. You got that water. You'll see it going to be. God's light. Overrated. Tell him why you mad, bro. Hey, hey, you're very far up. If it weren't for the Wayne Wade and Kobe Bryant, you'd never even heard of you. Because you've only been to the final once. I didn't know that. I didn't know that. The Wayne Ways and Kobe's co-tails. It doesn't matter. I got the same thing you got. And I passed you up ten years. Just letting you know. I fight. Anyway, I've been riding on Kobe's co-tails. Anyway, Wayne Ways and I lost all my friends. I forgot about that. I was going for those guys. And I brought you a box. Rick Fox. People question why you have all this. I said, anyway, bum. I would say this. What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? Stinking in the middle of a street. You going across the street and you're underwear? Yeah. To see where. No, I was swimming. Swimming where? It's a pool in my office, fool. I was somebody hit your ass. Me too. He's somebody run over. I can't go. I'm going to be dead. Come on. I can't hold. I can't hold. I can't hold. Come on. It's not going to happen. I was going to be one of us that game. I want Ken to tell you a story how I kidnap Ken J. How long ago was this? He was in kindergarten. He was in kindergarten and his daughter and my daughter. I mean, Ken J went to the same school. And I came to the school pick him up and they were like, I'm going to be a jack. I was like, what do you mean he's going with jack? I said, I don't even know on this phone number. I didn't call him out. I think it's you knew him. But in Pharaoh. Inning. He might have got a confused one in his seventh. That was wrong. That was wrong. That was wrong. Chuck. No, you know, cross the line, Chuck. You insulted him a little bit. Yeah. My youngest son's birthday today. Shaker. Big dude. Happy birthday. Love you brother. You know that's all I have to tell you. I wish you all your kids had a birthday. This is all I have for that one show. That's a wrap for Inside the NBA. Another kid of Shaker. A new will be announcing to us. It's presented by Kea. Okay. For Charles and Kenny and for Shack and Sharif. Bernie Johnson. See you tomorrow. All right. Call me. Call me. Ha.
